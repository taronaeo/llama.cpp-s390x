# Llama.cpp GitHub Self-Hosted Runners Audit Script
#
# This script performs a security audit of the GitHub self-hosted runners used
# in the Llama.cpp repository. It checks for potential vulnerabilities,
# misconfigurations, and ensures that the runners are secure. If any of the
# self-hosted runners are found to be vulnerable or misconfigured, the script
# will exit with a non-zero status code.
#
# Note: Llama.cpp maintainers reserve the right to take appropriate actions,
#       including but not limited to disabling or removing any self-hosted
#       runners that are found to be vulnerable or misconfigured.
# Note: Llama.cpp maintainers will run audits on a periodic basis to ensure
#       the security of the self-hosted runners. We do not guarantee that
#       all vulnerabilities will be detected, but we will make every effort
#       to identify and address any issues that are found.
#
# Usage: ./audit.sh
